Create a new folder for your project, navigate to it in the command line,
and initialize a new Node.js project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

Next, install all the Node.js dependencies we're going to use. In this case it will be [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
(utility for initializing environment variables from a file), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) (web framework),
and [cookie-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-session) for handling cookie-based sessions, and finally the necessary APS SDK including:

```bash
npm install --save dotenv express cookie-session 
npm install --save @aps_sdk/authentication  @aps_sdk/data-management  @aps_sdk/construction-account-admin  @aps_sdk/construction-issues 
```

:::note
At the writing of this documentation, the tutorial sample is using the specified version next to the package name.

- [@aps_sdk/authentication v1.0.0 ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aps_sdk/authentication/v/1.0.0?activeTab=versions)
- [@aps_sdk/data-management v1.1.2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aps_sdk/data-management/v/1.1.2?activeTab=versions)
- [@aps_sdk/construction-account-admin v2.1.0-beta.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aps_sdk/construction-account-admin/v/2.1.0-beta.0?activeTab=versions)
- [@aps_sdk/construction-issues v3.0.0-beta.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aps_sdk/construction-issues/v/3.0.0-beta.0?activeTab=versions)

:::


The `"dependencies"` in your `package.json` file should now look something like this
(potentially with slightly different version numbers):

```json
// ...
  "dependencies": {
    "@aps_sdk/authentication": "^1.0.0",
    "@aps_sdk/construction-account-admin": "^2.1.0-beta.0",
    "@aps_sdk/construction-issues": "^3.0.0-beta.0",
    "@aps_sdk/data-management": "^1.1.2",
    "cookie-session": "^2.1.1",
    "dotenv": "^17.2.3",
    "express": "^5.1.0"
  }
// ...
```

Finally, let's create a couple more subfolders in your project folder that we're going to need later:

- `wwwroot` - this is where we're going to put all the client side assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.)
- `routes` - this is where we're going to implement all the server endpoints
- `services` - here we're going to keep all the server-side logic that can be shared by different endpoints
