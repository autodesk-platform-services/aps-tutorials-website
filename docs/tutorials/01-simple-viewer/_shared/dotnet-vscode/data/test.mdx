Time to test our improved server application. This time, apart from setting the Forge application
credentials, you can also include the name of the Data Management bucket you want to use via
the optional `FORGE_BUCKET` environment variable:

```bash
export FORGE_CLIENT_ID=your-own-forge-client-id
export FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-own-forge-client-secret
export FORGE_BUCKET=your-custom-bucket-name
dotnet run
```

:::info
If the bucket name is _not_ provided, the `ForgeService` class will generate one by appending `-basic-app`
to your Forge client ID.
:::

:::caution
Note that the Data Management service requires bucket names to be **globally unique**,
and attempts to create a bucket with an already used name will fail with `409 Conflict`.
See the [documentation](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/buckets-POST)
for more details.

When you navigate to [http://localhost:8080/api/models](http://localhost:8080/api/models)
in the browser, the server should respond with a JSON list with names and URNs of all objects
available in your configured bucket. If you are getting started, you may get a JSON response
with an empty array (`[]`) which is expected. In the screenshot below we can already see a couple
of files that were uploaded to our bucket in the past.
