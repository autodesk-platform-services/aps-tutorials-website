# Project Issues

Now, we will implement our server to consume [ACC Issues APIs](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/overview/field-guide/issues/) to fetch project issues and create/modify issues.

## ACC Issue SDK
First, let's include the ACC Issue SDK:
<EnvTabs NodeJsVsCode={NodeJsVsCodeSDK} DotNetVsCode={DotNetSDK} DotNetVs2022={DotNetSDK} />


:::tip
Issues is a collection managed on APS cloud database. To have nice performance of the call, it is a web standard of HTTP request that each call only returns partial records of the collection, called **pagination**. 
With current design, ACC Issue returns 1-100 issues in one call by default. We also have chance to specify the **limit** parameter which indicates how many records in one page. The other parameter **offset** specifies from which index of issue to extract the records.
Check API reference of [GET:Issues](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/issues-issues-GET/) for more information.
:::


## Import Issues
Moving forward, we will add helper functions to create and modify issues. [POST Issues](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/issues-issues-POST/) for creating a new issue. 
[PATCH Issues/:IssueId](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/issues-issues-issueId-PATCH/) for modifying an existing issue. When the server side receives imported records from client side (csv), it will check if the record has value with **Id**, if no, it will go to the branch to create a new issue. If yes, it will modify the exsisting issue with updated data. 

For tracking the status, a json array makes a note on those created or modfied issues, or the failed call with corresponding csv row number.


<EnvTabs NodeJsVsCode={NodeJsVsCodeImportIssues} DotNetVsCode={DotNetImportIssues} DotNetVs2022={DotNetImportIssues} />


:::tip
The APIs of creating issue and modifying issues only accept a few fields in the payload. This sample isolates the extracted csv data with a few fields:

- title
- description
- issueSubtypeId
- status
- dueDate
- assignedTo
- assignedToType
- rootCauseId
- published

## Server endpoints

Next, let's expose the routings to extract issues and import issue to the client-side code through another
set of endpoints. 


<EnvTabs NodeJsVsCode={NodeJsVsCodeEndpoints} DotNetVsCode={DotNetEndpoints} DotNetVs2022={DotNetEndpoints} />


## Try it out

And that's it for the server side. Time to try it out!

- Use same project ID in previous step (remove b.) and try to call the endpoint: 
[http://localhost:8080/api/issues/issues?projectId={your-project-id}](http://localhost:8080/api/issues/issues?projectId={your-project-id}), the server application should
respond with a JSON list of all the issues from this project.

:::info
It would take a bit long time if the volume of the issue records is large.
This sample extract raw data of issue directly. Some fields are json object or array object. Their value will be in string.
:::

- To test creating or modifying issues, use HTTP test tools or commandline scripts to perform the test with access token and request payload.

Recommended HTTP test tools: [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/), [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
