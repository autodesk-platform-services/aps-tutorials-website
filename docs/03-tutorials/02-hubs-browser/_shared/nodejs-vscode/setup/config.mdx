Create a `config.js` file in the root of your project folder, and add the following code:

```js title="config.js"
require('dotenv').config();

let { APS_CLIENT_ID, APS_CLIENT_SECRET, APS_CALLBACK_URL, SERVER_SESSION_SECRET, PORT } = process.env;
if (!APS_CLIENT_ID || !APS_CLIENT_SECRET || !APS_CALLBACK_URL || !SERVER_SESSION_SECRET) {
    console.warn('Missing some of the environment variables.');
    process.exit(1);
}
const INTERNAL_TOKEN_SCOPES = ['data:read'];
const PUBLIC_TOKEN_SCOPES = ['viewables:read'];
PORT = PORT || 8080;

module.exports = {
    APS_CLIENT_ID,
    APS_CLIENT_SECRET,
    APS_CALLBACK_URL,
    SERVER_SESSION_SECRET,
    INTERNAL_TOKEN_SCOPES,
    PUBLIC_TOKEN_SCOPES,
    PORT
};
```

The `dotenv` library initializes environment variables from a local _.env_ file (if there's one).
We then simply read the environment variables from `process.env`, and exit the application
immediately if any of the required properties are missing.

Next, let's create the _.env_ file in the project folder, and populate it with the required
environment variables (replacing `<client-id>` and `<client-secret>` with your APS Client ID
and Client Secret, and `<secret-phrase>` with an arbitrary string):

``` title=".env"
APS_CLIENT_ID="<client-id>"
APS_CLIENT_SECRET="<client-secret>"
APS_CALLBACK_URL="http://localhost:8080/api/auth/callback" # URL your users will be redirected to after logging in with their Autodesk account
SERVER_SESSION_SECRET="<secret-phrase>" # secret phrase used to encrypt/decrypt server session cookies
```

:::caution
Since the `.env` file contains sensitive information, make sure that it is **not** included in git!
This can be ensured by adding the `.env` line to the [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file.

Now, in order to be able to run and debug our application from Visual Studio Code, we need to create
a [launch configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations).
Use _Run > Add Configuration_ in the menu to create a new configuration, and when prompted
for the specific environment, choose _Node.js_. This will create a new _.vscode_
subfolder in your project with a _launch.json_ file where you can define different
launch configurations. Replace the content of the file with the following:

```json title=".vscode/launch.json"
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Server",
            "runtimeExecutable": "npm",
            "runtimeArgs": [
                "start"
            ],
            "skipFiles": [
                "<node_internals>/**/*.js"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

We are defining a single launch configuration called _Launch Server_ that will simply
start our application using the `npm start` command.
