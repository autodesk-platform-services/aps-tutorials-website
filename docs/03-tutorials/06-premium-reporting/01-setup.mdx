# Application Setup

Let's start by creating a new project, installing required dependencies, and setting up
a basic server application.

Create a new folder for your project, navigate to it in the command line, and initialize a new Node.js project.

## New project

<EnvTabs NodeJsVsCode={NodeJsVsCodeProject} />

## Application config

Our application will need a couple of configuration parameters to run properly, for example, the credentials of our APS app for communicating with Autodesk Platform Services, or the callback URL where our users
will be redirected to during the 3-legged authentication workflow. We will pass these parameters to the server app using environment variables.

Finally, let's create a couple more subfolders in your project folder that we're going to need later:
• wwwroot - this is where we're going to put all the client side assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.)
• routes - this is where we're going to implement all the server endpoints
• services - here we're going to keep all the server-side logic that can be shared by different endpoints

<EnvTabs NodeJsVsCode={NodeJsVsCodeConfig} />

## Basic server

Next we'll create a basic server application.

<EnvTabs NodeJsVsCode={NodeJsVsCodeServer} />

## Try it out

Now that we have a basic application setup, let's try it out!

<EnvTabs NodeJsVsCode={NodeJsVsCodeTest} />
