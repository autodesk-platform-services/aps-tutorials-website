# ACC Issues

## Introduction

:::note
Ensure **[Issue Module](https://help.autodesk.com/view/BUILD/ENU/?guid=Issues_About)** is activated in ACC Project.
:::


In this tutorial we're going to build an APS application that will let us browse Hubs and Projects
of our authenticated user in [Autodesk Construction Cloud](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-docs/overview),
extract project issues, issue subtypes, issue rootcauses, issue Attribute Definitions of a 
given ACC project and  render them in a tabular view, list all the information of project users,you can also export these information to a CSV
file easily as well as import from an external CSV. Most important, the tutorial will show case how to:
1. Export project issues into a csv file
2. Import issues from external CSV file into the ACC project to create new or existing  issue.


:::note
Make sure to [provision access](../../01-getting-started/index.mdx#provision-access-in-other-products) to your ACC accounts
so that the application can see your project issues.

We will use the following components of the platform:

- [Authentication](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/developers_guide/overview)
- [Data Management](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/developers_guide/overview)
- [Autodesk Construction Cloud Admin](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/overview/field-guide/admin/)
- [Autodesk Construction Issues](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/overview/field-guide/issues/)

:::tip
If you're not interested in building the application from scratch, and you just want to try
and run it locally, the complete implementation is available on GitHub:
