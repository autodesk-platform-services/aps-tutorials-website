title: Define Activity

import ResponsiveVideo from "@site/src/components/ResponsiveVideo.js";
import PreviewUrl from "@site/static/videos/define-activity.mp4";
import ActivityNet6 from "./_shared/dotnet-vs2022/setup/activity.mdx";
import ActivityNodeJs from "./_shared/nodejs-vscode/setup/activity.mdx";
import CodeBlockTabs from "@site/src/components/CodeBlockTabs.js";

Activity is the specification of an action that can be executed using a specified engine. It specifies the number of input and output files, and the AppBundle and entry-point to use.

In this tutorial sample, the activity has 2 inputs (file & JSON data) and 1 output (file).

<CodeBlockTabs NET6={ActivityNet6} NodeJS={ActivityNodeJs} />

Now you can click on Configure (top-right), select the AppBundle, select the Engine
and click on Define Activity, which should define and upload the appbundle and define
the activity. The results panel (left-side) shows the respective ids. All other buttons
do not work yet... let's move forward.

<ResponsiveVideo src={PreviewUrl} />
