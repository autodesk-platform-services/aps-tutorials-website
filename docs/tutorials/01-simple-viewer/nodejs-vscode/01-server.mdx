# Basic Server

In this step we're going to create a new Node.js project, install all the required dependencies,
and setup a basic [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) server.

## Project & dependencies

Create a new folder for your project, navigate to it in the command line, and initialize a new
Node.js project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

Next, install all the Node.js dependencies we're going to use. In this case it will be
the [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) framework, an Express.js [middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html)
for handling `multipart/form-data` requests, and finally the [Forge SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forge-apis):

```bash
npm install --save express express-formidable forge-apis
```

The `"dependencies"` in your `package.json` file should now look something like this (potentially
with slightly different version numbers):

```json
// ...
"dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "express-formidable": "^1.2.0",
    "forge-apis": "^0.8.6"
}
// ...
```

Finally, let's create a couple more subfolders in the project folder that we're going to need later:

- `wwwroot` - this is where we're going to put all the client side assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.)
- `routes` - this is where we're going to implement all the server endpoints
- `services` - here we're going to keep all the server-side logic that can be shared by different endpoints

## Application config

Our Node.js application will need a couple of configuration parameters to run properly, for example,
the app credentials for communicating with Autodesk Forge services (Forge client ID and secret), and
the name of a bucket in the [Data Management](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/developers_guide/overview)
service for storing uploaded designs. We will pass these parameters to the server app using environment variables.

Create a `config.js` file in the root of your project folder, and add the following code:

```js title="config.js"
let { FORGE_CLIENT_ID, FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET, FORGE_BUCKET, PORT } = process.env;
if (!FORGE_CLIENT_ID || !FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET) {
    console.warn('Missing some of the environment variables.');
    process.exit(1);
}
FORGE_BUCKET = FORGE_BUCKET || `${FORGE_CLIENT_ID.toLowerCase()}-basic-app`;
PORT = PORT || 8080;

module.exports = {
    FORGE_CLIENT_ID,
    FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET,
    FORGE_BUCKET,
    PORT
};
```

We simply read the environment variables from `process.env`, and exit the application
immediately if any of the required properties are missing. And if no bucket name is provided,
we generate one by appending the `-basic-app` suffix to the Forge Client ID.

:::caution
Note that the Data Management service requires bucket names to be **globally unique**,
and attempts to create a bucket with an already used name will fail with `409 Conflict`.
See the [documentation](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/buckets-POST)
for more details.

## Create a basic server

Create a `server.js` file in the root of your project folder with the following code:

```js title="server.js"
const express = require('express');
const { PORT } = require('./config.js');

let app = express();
app.use(express.static('wwwroot'));
app.listen(PORT, function () { console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}...`); });
```

For now the server isn't doing much, just serving static assets from the `public` subfolder
(which is currently empty), and reporting all errors to the console and back to the client.

Next, let's add a `"start": "node server.js"` script to the `package.json` file so that we can
easily run our application later:

```json
// ...
"scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
}
// ...
```

## Try it out

Try setting your own Forge client ID and secret as the `FORGE_CLIENT_ID` and `FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET`
environment variables, and run the application:

```bash
export FORGE_CLIENT_ID=your-own-forge-client-id
export FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-own-forge-client-secret
npm start
```

Then open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
The server should respond with `Cannot GET /` because we haven't added any logic to it just yet.
That's going to be the topic of the next step.
