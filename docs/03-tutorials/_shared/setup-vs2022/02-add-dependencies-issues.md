Next we will need to install the dependencies. In this case it will be a couple of modules
of the official APS SDK. In the _Solution Explorer_,
right-click on _Dependencies_, and then click on _Manage NuGet Packages..._:

![Manage NuGet dependencies](manage-nugets.webp)

In the _NuGet Package Manager_, switch to the _Browse_ tab, and search for and install
the following packages:

- [Autodesk.Authentication](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Autodesk.Authentication)
- [Autodesk.DataManagement](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Autodesk.DataManagement)
- [Autodesk.Construction.Issues](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Autodesk.Construction.Issues)
- [Adsk.Platform.ACC.AccountAdmin](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Adsk.Platform.ACC.AccountAdmin)
