Create a new folder for your project, navigate to it in the command line, and initialize a new
ASP.NET Core project:

```bash
dotnet new web
```

Next we will need to install the dependencies. In this case it will be the required APS SDK packages:

```bash
dotnet add package Autodesk.Authentication --version 2.0.0-beta4
dotnet add package Autodesk.DataManagement --version 2.0.0-beta4
```

The `*.csproj` file in your project should now look similar to this (possibly with
slightly different version numbers, and additional .NET settings):

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Autodesk.Authentication" Version="2.0.0-beta4" />
    <PackageReference Include="Autodesk.DataManagement" Version="2.0.0-beta4" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

Finally, let's create a couple more subfolders in your project folder that we're going to need later:

- `Controllers` - this is where we're going to implement all the server endpoints
- `Models` - here we're going to keep all the server-side logic that can be shared by different endpoints
- `wwwroot` - this is where we're going to put all the client side assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.)

:::note
If the `.vscode` folder is not created automatically, you can create it via the Run & Debug sidepanel
:::

To create the `.vscode` folder click on the *Run and Debug tool on the left sidepanel > create a launch.json file > Select .NET & .NET Core*.
