Create a `Startup.cs` file in the root folder of your project with the following content:

```csharp title="Startup.cs"
using System;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

public class Startup
{
    public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        Configuration = configuration;
    }

    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

    // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddControllers();
        var ForgeClientID = Configuration["FORGE_CLIENT_ID"];
        var ForgeClientSecret = Configuration["FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET"];
        var ForgeCallbackURL = Configuration["FORGE_CALLBACK_URL"];
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(ForgeClientID) || string.IsNullOrEmpty(ForgeClientSecret) || string.IsNullOrEmpty(ForgeCallbackURL))
        {
            throw new ApplicationException("Missing required environment variables FORGE_CLIENT_ID, FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET, or FORGE_CALLBACK_URL.");
        }
    }

    // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        if (env.IsDevelopment())
        {
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        }
        app.UseDefaultFiles();
        app.UseStaticFiles();
        app.UseRouting();
        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapControllers();
        });
    }
}
```

The `Startup` class is responsible for configuring our server and its "middleware" (for example,
serving of static files), and for retrieving the configuration intpus from environment variables
(or from other [configuration providers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?view=aspnetcore-6.0#configuration-providers))
for later use.

Now, to pass actual configuration values to our application for debugging purposes,
we will modify the `appsettings.Development.json` file in our project folder,
or create one of it does not exist, with the following content (using your own
values instead of the placeholders of course):

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "FORGE_CLIENT_ID": "your-client-id",
  "FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET": "your-client-secret",
  "FORGE_CALLBACK_URL": "http://localhost:8080/api/auth/callback"
}
```

:::caution
Since the `appsettings.Development.json` file contains sensitive information, make sure that it is **not** included in git!
This can be ensured by adding the `appsettings.Development.json` line to the [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file.
