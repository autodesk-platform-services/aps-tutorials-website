# ACC Issues

## Introduction

In this tutorial we're going to build an APS application that allows the authenticated user in [Autodesk Construction Cloud](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-docs/overview) to 
extract project issues and issues settings: sub types, root causes, custom attribute of a 
given ACC project. This application renders these data in a tabular view. The data can also be exported to CSV
file easily. With the data from a CSV, the application demos the scenario that imports them to create new issues or modify the existing issues.
 

:::note
- This sample does not demo how to work with document issue (also called pushpin or markup issue).
- This sample will iterate ACC hubs and project lists. It also extracts some admin data such as project users. Please make sure to [provision access](../../01-getting-started/index.mdx#provision-access-in-other-products) to your ACC accounts.
- Ensure **[Issue Module](https://help.autodesk.com/view/BUILD/ENU/?guid=Issues_About)** has been activated in ACC Project. 
- Issue API supports user context of authentication only. Ensure the logged user has permissions to access expected related issues. See **[Issues Permission](https://help.autodesk.com/view/BUILD/ENU/?guid=Issues_Permissions)**

We will use the following APIs of Autodesk Platform Services (APS):

- [Authentication](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/developers_guide/overview)
- [Data Management](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/developers_guide/overview)
- [Autodesk Construction Cloud Admin](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/overview/field-guide/admin/)
- [Autodesk Construction Issues](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/overview/field-guide/issues/)


:::tip
If you're not interested in building the application from scratch, and you just want to try
and run it locally, the complete implementation is available on GitHub:
- NodeJS: https://github.com/autodesk-platform-services/aps-acc-issues-tutorial-nodejs
- DotNet: https://github.com/autodesk-platform-services/aps-acc-issues-tutorial-dotnet
