If the application is still running, restart it (for example, using Run > Restart Debugging, or by clicking the green restart icon), otherwise start it again (using Run > Start Debugging, or by pressing F5).
When you navigate to http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login in the browser, you should be redirected to Autodesk login page, and after logging in, you should be redirected back to your application, for now simply showing Cannot GET /. This is expected as we haven't implemented the GET / endpoint yet. However, if you use browser dev tools and explore the cookies stored by your browser for the localhost origin, you'll notice that the application is already storing the authentication data there.
