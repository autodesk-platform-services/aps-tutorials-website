# Getting Started

Complete these steps before building your first [Autodesk Platform Services](https://aps.autodesk.com) application.

## Create an account

If you don't have an Autodesk account, create one at [aps.autodesk.com](https://aps.autodesk.com).

1. Go to [aps.autodesk.com](https://aps.autodesk.com) and click **Sign in**.
2. Click **Create account**.
3. Complete the form and verify your email.

## Create a developer hub

A developer hub is where you create and manage your APS apps.

### Prerequisites

- An [Autodesk account](https://www.autodesk.com/) (created in the previous step)
- An [Autodesk team](https://www.autodesk.com/support/account/admin/users/manage-teams) with an [APS subscription (Free tier or Paid)](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-platform-services/overview?_gl=1*80a9j5*FPAU*MTQ3ODg2NTk5MS4xNzYzNjkxNjI2*_ga*OTMzMjUyMTQ5LjE3NjkyMTI0NTk.*_ga_NZSJ72N6RX*czE3NjkyMTIxMTkkbzEkZzEkdDE3NjkyMTI0NjYkajUyJGwwJGgw*_fplc*NGw5T0ttY0ZVemZjYjhtaWtXNFNKS1ZPRUw4ZFlUbHJPTDQ5Q1FOMm1ldTNzdllGVmR4UllNU1ZZTEdKazFFV1kxQjJ3end3T3U0R2NZa1glMkZMdU0lMkJIM3NQcDVTSUtwOHpaWFdDWFAlMkJtamFtY1d5N01qdG5aYld3V21TaTdnJTNEJTNE#pricing)

:::tip
Most developers start with the Free tier, which provides monthly access to APS APIs with usage caps on paid APIs.
:::

### Create a developer hub

1. Sign in to [manage.autodesk.com](https://manage.autodesk.com/).
2. Click **Products and Services**, then click the **Hubs** tab.
3. Click **Create hub**.
4. Select **APS Developer Hub** as the product.
5. Enter a hub name and optional description.
6. Click **Create & Activate**.
7. Refresh the page, then click your hub name to open the developer portal.

## Create app credentials

To authenticate with APS APIs, you need a client ID and client secret. You get these by creating an app in your developer hub.

1. In your developer hub, go to the **Applications** page.
2. Click **Create application**.
3. Enter a name for your app.
4. Select the application type that matches your use case:
    - **Traditional Web App** for cases where your application runs on a server (e.g., a web app with a backend server).
    - **Desktop, Mobile, Single-Page App** for cases where your application will run on a user's device (e.g., a mobile app, a desktop application, or a web app that runs entirely in the browser).
    - **Server-to-Server App** for cases where your application runs on a server and does not require user authentication (e.g., backend services, daemons, or applications that access APS APIs on behalf of themselves rather than a user).
5. Click **Create**.

/>

### Configure your app

1. In the **Callback URL** field, enter the URL where users will be redirected after signing in. For local development, we recommend using `http://localhost:8080/api/auth/callback`.
2. Under **API Access**, select the APIs your app needs.
3. Click **Save changes**.

:::note
The callback URL must exactly match the URL your application expects. Mismatched URLs will cause authentication to fail.

## Provision access in other products

In certain cases it is possible for your application to integrate with other APS-based products
such as [Autodesk Construction Cloud](https://construction.autodesk.com),
or [Autodesk BIM 360](https://www.autodesk.com/bim-360). We leverage this capability in
the [Hubs Browser](./tutorials/hubs-browser) and [ACC Administrator](./tutorials/acc-admin) tutorials where you can learn about accessing designs
from [Autodesk Docs](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-docs/overview),
[BIM 360 Docs](https://www.autodesk.com/bim-360/construction-document-management-software/),
or [Fusion Teams](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview).

However, some of these products must _provision access_ for a specific APS application
based on its client ID. Follow the steps below for any specific product you would like
to integrate your application with.

:::info
If you are _not_ planning to integrate your application with other products for now,
you can skip the rest of this page and come back to it later when needed.

No provisioning steps are needed. Your APS application can automatically access
the data of your authenticated users in this product.
