# Issue Settings

In the previous step, we extracted the raw data of issues. 
The values of some fields are specific **ids** such as `Issue Sub Type`, `Root Cause`. And `Custom Attributes` is in for patten of id & value.
They are **Issue Settings**. To get their information with the **ids**, we will need to call more Issues APIs.

In addition, the APIs permissions follows the user permission setting of the logged user, who authorizes this sample to manipulate the issues. 

<EnvTabs NodeJsVsCode={NodeJsVsCodeIssuesSettings} DotNetVsCode={DotNetIssuesSettings} DotNetVs2022={DotNetIssuesSettings} />


:::info
**Issue Sub Type** is a child of **Issue Type** . This sample iterates each type, 
extracts its sub types to build the collection.

similarly, **Issue Root Cause** is a child of **Issue Root Cause Caregory**. 
This sample iterates each category , extracts its root causes to build the collection.

The corresponding APIs also return types or categories in **pagination**.

No API yet to get permissions table like ACC UI does: [Issues Permission](https://help.autodesk.com/view/BUILD/ENU/?guid=Issues_Permissions). Current API supports to fetch the logged user permission.

## Server endpoints

Next, let's expose the routings to extract issues and import issue to the client-side code through another
set of endpoints. Append these endpoints to  `issue.js` file with the following content:
 

<EnvTabs NodeJsVsCode={NodeJsVsCodeEndpoints} DotNetVsCode={DotnetEndpoints} DotNetVs2022={DotnetEndpoints} />


## Try it out

And that's it for the server side. Time to try it out!

- Use same project ID in previous step (remove b.) and try to call the endpoint: 
[http://localhost:8080/api/issues/subtypes?projectId={your-project-id}](http://localhost:8080/api/issues/subtypes?projectId={your-project-id}), the server application should
respond with a JSON list of all the issue sub types from this project.
