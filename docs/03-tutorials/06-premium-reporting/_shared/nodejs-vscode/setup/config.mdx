Create a `config.js` file in the root of your project folder, and add the following code:

```js title="config.js"
const { Scopes } = require("@aps_sdk/authentication");
require("dotenv").config();

let {
  APS_CLIENT_ID,
  APS_CLIENT_SECRET,
  APS_CALLBACK_URL,
  SERVER_SESSION_SECRET,
  PORT,
} = process.env;
if (
  !APS_CLIENT_ID ||
  !APS_CLIENT_SECRET ||
  !APS_CALLBACK_URL ||
  !SERVER_SESSION_SECRET
) {
  console.warn("Missing some of the environment variables.");
  process.exit(1);
}
const INTERNAL_TOKEN_SCOPES = [Scopes.DataRead, Scopes.ViewablesRead];
const PUBLIC_TOKEN_SCOPES = [Scopes.ViewablesRead];
PORT = PORT || 8080;

module.exports = {
  APS_CLIENT_ID,
  APS_CLIENT_SECRET,
  APS_CALLBACK_URL,
  SERVER_SESSION_SECRET,
  INTERNAL_TOKEN_SCOPES,
  PUBLIC_TOKEN_SCOPES,
  PORT,
};
```

The `dotenv` library initializes environment variables from a local _.env_ file (if there's one).
We then simply read the environment variables from `process.env`, and exit the application
immediately if any of the required properties are missing. And if no bucket name is provided
for where our designs should be stored, we generate one by appending the `-basic-app` suffix
to our application Client ID.

Next, let's create the _.env_ file in the project folder, and populate it with the required
environment variables (replacing `<client-id>` and `<client-secret>` with your APS Client ID
and Client Secret):

```title=".env"
APS_CLIENT_ID="<client-id>"
APS_CLIENT_SECRET="<client-secret>"
APS_CALLBACK_URL="http://localhost:8080/api/auth/callback" # URL your users will be redirected to after logging in with their Autodesk account
SERVER_SESSION_SECRET="<secret-phrase>" # secret phrase used to encrypt/decrypt server session cookies

```

:::caution
Since the `.env` file contains sensitive information, make sure that it is **not** included in git!
This can be ensured by adding the `.env` line to the [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file.

Now, in order to be able to run and debug our application from Visual Studio Code, we need to create
a [launch configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations).
Use _Run > Add Configuration_ in the menu to create a new configuration, and when prompted
for the specific environment, choose _Node.js_. This will create a new `.vscode`
subfolder in your project with a `launch.json` file where you can define different
launch configurations. Replace the content of the file with the following:

```json title=".vscode/launch.json"
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Launch Server",
      "runtimeExecutable": "npm",
      "runtimeArgs": ["start"],
      "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**/*.js"]
    }
  ]
}
```

We are defining a single launch configuration called _Launch Server_ that will simply
start our application using the `npm start` command.
