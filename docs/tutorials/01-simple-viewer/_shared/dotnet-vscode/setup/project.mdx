Create a new folder for your project, navigate to it in the command line, and initialize a new
ASP.NET Core project:

```bash
dotnet new web
```

Next we will need to install the dependencies. In this case it will just be the
[Forge SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Autodesk.Forge):

```bash
dotnet add package Autodesk.Forge
```

The `*.csproj` file in your project should now look similar to this (possibly with
slightly different version numbers, and additional .NET settings):

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Autodesk.Forge" Version="1.9.0" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>

```

Finally, let's create a couple more subfolders in your project folder that we're going to need later:

- `Controllers` - this is where we're going to implement all the server endpoints
- `Models` - here we're going to keep all the server-side logic that can be shared by different endpoints
- `wwwroot` - this is where we're going to put all the client side assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.)
