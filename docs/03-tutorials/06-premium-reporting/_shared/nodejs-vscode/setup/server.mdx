Create a `server.js` file in the root of your project folder with the following code:

```js title="server.js"
const express = require("express");
const session = require("cookie-session");
const { PORT, SERVER_SESSION_SECRET } = require("./config.js");

let app = express();
app.use(express.static("wwwroot"));
app.use(
  session({ secret: SERVER_SESSION_SECRET, maxAge: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 })
);
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}...`));
```

For now the server isn't doing much, just serving client side assets from the wwwroot subfolder, and accessing session data stored in cookies. The cookies will be encrypted using a secret phrase that we will need to pass to the application via the environment variable SERVER_SESSION_SECRET.

Next, let's add a "start": "node server.js" script to the package.json file so that we can easily run our application later:

```json
// ...
"scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
}
// ...
```
