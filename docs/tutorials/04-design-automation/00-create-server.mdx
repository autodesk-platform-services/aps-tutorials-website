Your `Client ID` & `Secret` should be protected and keep confidential as all your files will be bound to your account. For a web application, keep it on your server. This section demonstrate how to prepare create a local development server.

Please review [Environment Setup](https://tutorials.autodesk.io/setup/) section for required software.

## Prerequisites

### ngrok

When Design Automation finishes modifying your model, it notifies back. As your machine is not exposed on the web, the [ngrok tool](https://ngrok.com/) create a temporary address to receive notifications. This tool is only required locally.
After download, unzip it. Open the Windows Command Line Prompt `cmd.exe` and navigate to the folder.
Then run `ngrok http 3000 --host-header="localhost:3000"`.
Copy the forwarding URL value ex:`http://1ab2c3d4.ngrok.com`

:::note
Setting up ngrok is an optional, to intercept webhook you can also use online tools like https://requestcatcher.com/
:::
:::warning
ngrok exposes your localhost server to the web while it is in use. Be sure to turn it off when your testing it done. Do not use this outside development environment
