# Project Browsing

The base URI schema of ACC Issue API is in the pattern: `https://developer.api.autodesk.com/construction/issues/v1/projects/:projectId`
, where the **projectId** is a required URI parameter. In this step we'll extend the server to browse the projects of Autodesk Construction Cloud, in order to fetch **project id**. 
We will basically get the hierarchy of hubs and projects using Data Management APIs.

## Browsing hubs

We will add a couple of helper methods for browsing through the hubs, projects:

<NodeJsVsCodeHubs />

## Server endpoints

Next, let's expose the new functionality to the client-side code through another
set of endpoints.
Data Management API returns plentiful data of the object. Our endpoints will extract partial data for client-side.

<NodeJsVsCodeEndpoints />

## Try it out

Start (or restart) the app from Visual Studio Code as usual, and navigate to
[http://localhost:8080/api/hubs](http://localhost:8080/api/hubs) in the browser.
The server should respond with a JSON list of all the hubs you have access to.

![Hubs Response](./_shared/hubs-response.webp)

Try copying the ID of one of the hubs, and use it in another address: http://localhost:8080/api/hubs/your-hub-id/projects.
In this case the server application should respond with a JSON list of all projects
available under the specified hub.

:::info
If you skipped the login procedure in the previous step, or restarted your server application,
you may need to go to [http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login](http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login)
again to make sure that all the authentication data is available in cookies before testing
the `/api/hubs` endpoint.

:::tip
If you are using Google Chrome, consider installing [JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en)
or a similar extension to automatically format JSON responses.
