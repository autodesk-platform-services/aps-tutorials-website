Create a new folder for your project, navigate to it in the command line,
and initialize a new Node.js project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

Next, install all the Node.js dependencies we're going to use. In this case it will be [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
(utility for initializing environment variables from a file), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) (web framework),
an Express.js [middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html)
for handling cookie-based sessions, and finally the necessary APS SDK including:
- [@aps_sdk/autodesk-sdkmanager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aps_sdk/autodesk-sdkmanager),
- [@aps_sdk/authentication](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aps_sdk/authentication),
- [@aps_sdk/data-management](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aps_sdk/data-management),
- [@aps_sdk/account-admin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aps_sdk/account-admin):


:::caution
The APS SDKs used in the tutorial are still “unstable” at this moment, they may change significantly.
Please use the exact same version to make sure the tutorial goes well, if you are using a different 
version of APS SDK, please make sure to catch up with all the changes. 
:::

```bash
npm install --save dotenv express cookie-session @aps_sdk/autodesk-sdkmanager @aps_sdk/authentication @aps_sdk/data-management @aps_sdk/account-admin
```

The `"dependencies"` in your `package.json` file should now look something like this
(potentially with slightly different version numbers):

```json
// ...
  "dependencies": {
    "@aps_sdk/account-admin": "^0.0.1-beta.1",
    "@aps_sdk/authentication": "^0.0.1-beta.1",
    "@aps_sdk/autodesk-sdkmanager": "^0.0.5-beta.1",
    "@aps_sdk/data-management": "^0.0.3-beta.1",
    "cookie-session": "^2.1.0",
    "dotenv": "^16.4.5",
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  },
// ...
```

Finally, let's create a couple more subfolders in your project folder that we're going to need later:

- `wwwroot` - this is where we're going to put all the client side assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.)
- `routes` - this is where we're going to implement all the server endpoints
- `services` - here we're going to keep all the server-side logic that can be shared by different endpoints
