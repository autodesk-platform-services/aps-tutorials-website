# Authentication

In this step we're going to extend the server implementation so that it can authenticate itself
to the Forge platform, and generate access tokens for different use cases.

:::tip
It is a good practice to generate an "internal" token with more capabilities (for example,
allowing you to create or delete files in the Data Management service) that will only be used
by the server, and a "public" token with fewer capabilities that can be safely shared with
the client-side logic.
:::

## Generate tokens

Create a `forge.js` file under the `services` subfolder. This is where we will be implementing
all the Forge-specific logic that will be used in different areas of our server application.
Let's start by adding the following code to the file:

```js title="services/forge.js"
const { AuthClientTwoLegged } = require('forge-apis');
const { FORGE_CLIENT_ID, FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET } = require('../config.js');

let internalAuthClient = new AuthClientTwoLegged(FORGE_CLIENT_ID, FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET, ['bucket:read', 'bucket:create', 'data:read', 'data:write', 'data:create'], true);
let publicAuthClient = new AuthClientTwoLegged(FORGE_CLIENT_ID, FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET, ['viewables:read'], true);

async function getInternalToken() {
    if (!internalAuthClient.isAuthorized()) {
        await internalAuthClient.authenticate();
    }
    return internalAuthClient.getCredentials();
}

async function getPublicToken() {
    if (!publicAuthClient.isAuthorized()) {
        await publicAuthClient.authenticate();
    }
    return publicAuthClient.getCredentials();
}

module.exports = {
    getPublicToken,
};
```

The code creates two authentication clients, one for generating tokens for internal use
(giving us read/write access to the Data Management buckets and objects), and one for generating
tokens for public use (only giving a read access to the translation outputs from the Model Derivative
service), and two helper methods to generate the corresponding tokens for us. The `getPublicToken` function
is exported from this script as we will use it in another part of our server application.

## Server endpoints

Next, let's add a first endpoint to our server. Create an `auth.js` file under the `routes` subfolder
with the following content:

```js title="routes/auth.js"
const express = require('express');
const { getPublicToken } = require('../services/forge.js');

let router = express.Router();

router.get('/token', async function (req, res, next) {
    try {
        res.json(await getPublicToken());
    } catch (err) {
        next(err);
    }
});

module.exports = router;
```

Here we implement a new [Express Router](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#router) that will handle
requests coming to our server, with the URL ending with `/token`, by generating a public access token
and sending it back to the client as a JSON response.

Let's "mount" the router to our server application by modifying the `server.js`:

```js title="server.js"
const express = require('express');
const { PORT } = require('./config.js');

let app = express();
app.use(express.static('wwwroot'));
// highlight-start
app.use('/api/auth', require('./routes/auth.js'));
// highlight-end
app.listen(PORT, function () { console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}...`); });
```

:::info
Since the router has been attached to the `/api/auth` prefix, it will now handle all requests
coming to the endpoint `/api/auth/token`.
:::

## Try it out

Let's see if our new server endpoint works. Don't forget setting your Forge client ID and client secret
as the `FORGE_CLIENT_ID` and `FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables, and run the application:

```bash
export FORGE_CLIENT_ID=your-own-forge-client-id
export FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-own-forge-client-secret
npm start
```

If the application starts successfully and you navigate to [http://localhost:8080/api/auth/token](http://localhost:8080/api/auth/token)
in the browser, the server should respond with a JSON object containing the access token data.
