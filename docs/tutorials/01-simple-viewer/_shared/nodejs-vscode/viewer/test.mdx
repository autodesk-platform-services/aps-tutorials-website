And that's it! Your application is now complete. Start (or restart) the app from Visual Studio Code as usual,
and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser. You should be presented with
a simple UI, with a dropdown in the top-right corner that will eventually get populated with all models
available in your application's bucket, and with a button for uploading new models. As soon as you
select one of the names from the dropdown, the corresponding model will get loaded in the viewer occupying
the rest of the webpage.
