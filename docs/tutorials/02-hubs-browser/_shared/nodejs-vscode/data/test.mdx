Time to try our improved server application. Start (or restart) the app from Visual Studio Code
as usual, and navigate to [http://localhost:8080/api/hubs](http://localhost:8080/api/hubs)
in the browser. The server should respond with a JSON list of all the hubs you have access to.
Try copying the ID of one of the hubs, and use it in another address: http://localhost:8080/api/hubs/your-hub-id/projects.
In this case the server application should respond with a JSON list of all projects
available under the specified hub.
