Create a new folder for your project, navigate to it in the command line, and initialize a new
ASP.NET Core project:

```bash
dotnet new web
```

Next we will need to install the dependencies. In this case it will just be the
[APS SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Autodesk.Forge):

```bash
dotnet add package Autodesk.Forge
```

The `*.csproj` file in your project should now look similar to this (possibly with
slightly different version numbers, and additional .NET settings):

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Autodesk.Forge" Version="1.9.7" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>

```

Finally, let's create a couple more subfolders in your project folder that we're going to need later:

- `Controllers` - this is where we're going to implement all the server endpoints
- `Models` - here we're going to keep all the server-side logic that can be shared by different endpoints
- `wwwroot` - this is where we're going to put all the client side assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.)

Now, when you open your project folder in Visual Studio Code for the first time, you will be prompted
to setup your project for .NET development. Accept the prompt, and the editor will automatically create
a `.vscode` subfolder with additional .NET specific settings such as the default [launch configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations).
The folder structure in the editor should look similar to this:
